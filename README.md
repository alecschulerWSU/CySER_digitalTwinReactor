Run "MainCode.m" prior to running simulations

Digital twin v2 and simulated physical reactor v3 are designed to be used together. Start DTRv2 on one computer, and you will have 15 seconds to start SPRv3.

If you want to test everything on a single computer, run SPRv4_isolated. This has no network communication capabilities.
